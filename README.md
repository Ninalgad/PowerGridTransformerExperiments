# PowerGridTransformerExperiments

Experiments using transformers for industrial physical simulation using [LIPS](https://github.com/IRT-SystemX/LIPS/tree/fb4048e274fb75dd963bd538429b6ece2df757d80) and Tensorflow. 
Following a couple better than state-of-the-art results, experiments are needed to find the ideal transformer architecture and to 
optimize hyperparameters.

Here, I will provide the training notebook and document results.

Requirements:
- Grid2Op==1.9.8
- lightsim2grid==0.7.5 
- leap-net==0.0.5
